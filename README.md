# recursive-stack
These are some recursive algorithms I made for stacks in Java.  
I use generic **Stack** and **Node** classes that I didn't make. 
The abstract data type was implemented with linked lists.

## This project includes:  
* **sumN:** Method which sums the first _n_ elements from the given stack.
* **copy:** Method which makes a copy of the given stack, leaving the original untouched.
